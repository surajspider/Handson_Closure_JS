    <h2>Q1. <pre>
            function counter(){
                var counter = 0;
                function IncreaseCounter() {
                    return counter += 1;
                };
                return IncreaseCounter;
            }
            var counter = counter();
            alert(counter());
            alert(counter());
            alert(counter());
            alert(counter());
    </pre> </h2>
    <h3 class="answer">Answer:</h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Output : <span class="backcolor">1 2 3 4</span></h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Reason - Firstly, <span class="backcolor">counter() function</span>
        is assigned to a variable <span class="backcolor">var counter</span> which is also known as the
        first class function. Now, variable <span class="backcolor">counter</span> holds a function
        <span class="backcolor">IncreaseCounter()</span> which is returned by a counter(). Initially, 
        counter is initialized with 0. So, whenver IncreaseCounter() is called, counter variable is incremented
        by 1 because the <span class="backcolor">counter variable is retained in the closure of the 
        IncreaseCounter()</span>.

    <h2>Q2. <pre>
        let count = 0;
        (function () {
            if (count === 0) {
                let count = 1;
                console.log(count); // What is logged?
            }
            console.log(count); // What is logged?
        })();
    </pre></h2>
    <h3 class="answer">Answer:</h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Output : <span class="backcolor">1 & 0</span></h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Reason: Count is declared and initialized with 0. The function is invoked immediately which is known as <span class="backcolor">IIFE(Immediately Invoked function
        Expression).</span> Now, the count is compared with 0 and passes into the if condition. Since, the second count variable is declared again with <span class="backcolor">let
        which is block scope.</span> so, count is declared again locally within the block scope and prints as 1. Then,globally the count value is 0. So, 
        now with help of <span class="backcolor">closure, count is found global and retains its value and prints 0.</span>

    <h2>Q3. <pre>
        for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            setTimeout(function log() {
              console.log(i); // What is logged?
            }, 1000);
          }
    </pre></h2>
    <h3 class="answer">Answer:</h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Output : <span class="backcolor">3 3 3</span></h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Reason: Here, the <span class="backcolor">setTimeout() function is looped three times from 0 to 2.</span> Mainly, 
        the looping variable is declared with <span class="backcolor">var i</span> and it is not block scope, instead it is functional scope. so, var i
        is incremented 3 times and <span class="backcolor">i=3 after one second (1000ms)</span>. Thus, it prints <span class="backcolor">3 3 3</span>

    <h2>Q4. Write a code to calculate area of a rectangle using inner function. In this case outer function should accept parameter length and inner 
        function should accept parameter breadth.
    </h2>
    <h3 class="answer">Answer:</h3>
    <h3 class="code"><pre>
        function outer(length) {
            function inner(breadth) {
                return length * breadth;
            }
            return inner;
        }
        var area = outer(5);
        console.log(area(5));
    </pre></h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Output : <span class="backcolor">25</span></h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Reason: Outer() function have a parameter called <span class="backcolor">length</span> is invoked and stored in a 
        <span class="backcolor">variable var area.</span> But the outer() returns the inner() function. So, logically var area is having <span class="backcolor">
        inner() function.</span> Now, outer(5) is passed and taken as length and area(5) is a inner() function with a parameter 5 which gets 
        multiplied and returned to area. With the help of closure, length variable is accessed from outer function even after the outer function is 
        already been executed. So, the output is <span class="backcolor">25</span>

    <h2>Q5. Take a variable in outer function and create an inner function to increase the counter every time it is called</h2>
    <h3 class="answer">Answer:</h3>
    <h3 class="code"><pre>
        function outer() {
            var count = 0;
            function inner() {
                count++;
                return count;
            }
            return inner;
        }
        var sample = outer();
        console.log(sample());
        console.log(sample());
        console.log(sample());
        console.log(sample());
        console.log(sample());
    </pre></h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Output : <span class="backcolor">1 2 3 4 5</span></h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Reason: The outer() is called and stored in sample variable which we know as a first class function. The Outer
        function <span class="backcolor">have a count variable initialized with 0</span>. outer() returns the inner() function which is stored in
        <span class="backcolor">var sample</span>. So, whenever the sample is invoked, count gets incremented and referenced with outer function 
        using closures. SO, whenever sample() is called, it directly invokes inner() function and count gets incremented and returned.

    </pre></h2>
    <h3 class="answer">Answer:</h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Output : <span class="backcolor">12</span></h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Reason: Simply, using <span class="backcolor">IIFE</span> function is invoked immediately. 
        <span class="backcolor">var a is declared globally and initialized with value 12.</span> function accesses variable a which is not 
        present inside the functional scope. So, with the help of closures it searches the variable out of the functional scope and accesses it 
        gloablly. Thus, it prints 12.

    <h3 class="answer">Answer:</h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Output : <span class="backcolor">12</span></h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Reason: var a is declared globally and stores 10. <span class="backcolor">var x stores the returned 
        inner function with alert(a).</span> The outer function is invoked using IIFE and inner function has a same variable a which is functional scoped
        and its value is 12. <span class="backcolor">So, when x() is called it prints 12.</span>

    <h3 class="answer">Answer:</h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Output : <span class="backcolor"><br>outerArg = 123<br>

        outerVar = a<br>
        innerVar = b<br>
        globalVar = xyz</span></h3>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Reason: <span class="backcolor">globalvar is a variable declared and initialized with a value "xyz" gloablly.</span>
        The outerFunc() is passed with <span class="backcolor">123</span> as an outerarg and it has a variable called 'a'. The innerFunc() is passed
        with <span class="backcolor">456</span> as an innerarg and it has a variable called 'b'. Thus the corresponding values are printed.
